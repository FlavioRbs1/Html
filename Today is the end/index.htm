                    <br>The road to hell isn't paved
                    <br>Not every soul can be saved (You reap what you sow)
                    <br>They kill and we give them fame
                    <br>So tell me who is to blame (You animal)
                    <br>Run, you better run, you better run
                    <br>Nowhere to run you can't get away from you
                    <br><br>The sun is black the sky is red
                    <br>And it feels like today is the end
                    <br>The kids are running as fast as they can
                    <br>Could it be that today is the end? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
                    <br><br>The silence echoes with rage
                    <br>How many more will it take? (You reap what you sow)
                    <br>When we're no longer afraid (Oh, oh)
                    <br>The devil loves a parade (You animal)
                    <br>Run, you better run, you better run
                    <br>Nowhere to run you can't get away from you
                    <br><br>The sun is black the sky is red
                    <br>And it feels like today is the end (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
                    <br>The kids are running as fast as they can
                    <br>Could it be that today is the end? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
                    <br><br>The sun is black the sky is red
                    <br>And it feels like today is the end (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
                    <br>The kids are running as fast as they can
                    <br>Could it be that today is the end?
                    <br><br>The sun is black the sky is red
                    <br>And it feels like today is the end (Fear in their eyes)
                    <br>The kids are running as fast as they can
                    <br>Could it be that today is the end? (Fear in their eyes)
                    <br>Today is the end (Fear in their eyes)
